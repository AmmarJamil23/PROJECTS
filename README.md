This repository contains all of my MERN stack projects that I have built while learning and improving my development skills.
Each folder is a separate complete project, covering different ideas, UIs, and backend implementations.
The purpose of this repo is to keep my work organized and show my progress in full-stack development.
All projects are built using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
I will keep adding more projects as I learn new concepts and build better applications.
